# ScriptEditorForYGOPRO2
edit those pesky s. and ids in Percy's script into proper id and function values used in YGOPRO2

So I was tired of manually editing some of the newest YGOPRO Percy's scripts replacing s. and id's to card ID values.
(Even mouse macro was not doing this fast enough)
So just select a folder containing scripts, and do everything. (Beware, doing everything autosaves the changes!)

**Warning! This program will not magically fix any ocgcore dependant stuff, so scripts may still not work properly on YGOPRO2 or other 
simulator that uses different ocgcore than Percy.**
